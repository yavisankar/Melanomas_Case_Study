# Project Name
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
Class rebalance plays a key role in the results. 
CNN with Class rebalance achieves a good accuracy score among train and validation sets. 
Training score reaches to 88 and validation score reaches to 83 which proves that, no overfitting exits. 
However, Model has not performed well on the Test unseen data and it got 0.33 as accuracy. Tuning the model by adding more layers / using different optimizers might help to improve the accuracy score.
